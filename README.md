# Author_Identification

This project detects the author of text with unknown authorship by comparing the unknown text with the dataset of authors and extracts from their novels. 

Technologies used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Machine Learning algorithms: Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression

Using data cleaning and feature extraction techniques, the writing style of each author has been analyzed ny building a write-print for every author.

Using this write-print, the text with unknown authorship is compared with it to find out the author of the text (even if the text is highly paraphrased) if the author of the text is one of the authors from the dataset otherwise it will give the output 'Author Not Found'.
